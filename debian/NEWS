tar (1.15.91-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream changed the default behavior of tar regarding wildcards in
    filenames.  You may need to add the new '--wildcards' option to scripts
    using tar if you depend on the old, undocumented behavior.  See the tar
    documentation (the wildcards menu item in the non-free package 'tar-doc', 
    or http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/wildcards.html)
    for more detailed information.
