# The --exclude-tag options interacted incorrectly with --listed-incremental
# since their very inception.  The testcases exclude08 through exclude16
# verify that --exclude-tag operates consistently whether or not
# --listed-incremental option is given.
#
# This testcase verifies whether the --exclude-tag-under option works
# as expected when used in conjunction with --listed-incremental.
# If the exclusion tag is created after the level 0 dump, the level
# 1 dump must skip the affected subdirectory and any previously-included
# files within it, including the tag file, but preserve the directory
# itself.
