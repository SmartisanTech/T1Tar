# Description: In tar 1.26 listed-incremental with -C and absolute path
# would malfunction under certain conditions due to buggy filename
# normalization.
#
# The value returned by normalize_filename() is used to populate the "caname"
# field in both the "directory" structure in incremen.c and the "name"
# structure in names.c, and in both cases that field is then used in the
# "hash" and "compare" functions for the related hash tables.  Thus, the
# fact that the returned value doesn't reflect the operation of previous
# "-C" options means that it's possible for two different directories to
# be given the same "caname" value in the hashed structure and thus end up
# being confused with each other.
#
# The bug is triggered when dumping both relative paths after -C and
# absolute paths that match the process' current working directory.
