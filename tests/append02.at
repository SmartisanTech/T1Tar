# Using tar 1.15.x the following equivalent command sets:
#
#   1. tar cf archive file1 file2
# and
#   2. tar cfT archive /dev/null
#      tar rf archive file1
#      tar rt archive file2
#
# produced different archives (GNU format is assumed). It was reported
# by TAMUKI Shoichi on 2006-07-21 [1].
#
# The bug was due to tar being unable to discern between GNU and OLDGNU
# formats and always assuming the latter. The main difference between
# the two is that OLDGNU preserves all bits in the mode field, whereas
# GNU format keeps only the lower 9 ones (mode & 0777).
#
# This was fixed on 2006-07-24 (commit f4e4adea80a) by making tar truncate
# the mode field even in OLDGNU format. Obviously, the fix broke the
# format backward compatibility, but it went unnoticed until 2009-10-03
# (after all, the OLDGNU format is not in much use nowadays), when
# Igor Zhbanov reported it [2].
#
# The final fix was applied on 2009-10-04.
