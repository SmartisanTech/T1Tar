# Tar up to 1.26 was unable to cope with directories that had once
# been part of the dumped system and became separate mount points
# afterwards.  The bug has been reported by Nathan Stratton Treadway,
# who also proposed a fix and a testcase, on which the present one is
# built.
# Reported-by: Nathan Stratton Treadway <nathanst+bugtar@ontko.com>

# This testcase is Linux-specific and requires root privileges.
