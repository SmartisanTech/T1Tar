# Description: ensure tar correctly respects -C option when deleting
# files due to the --remove-files option.
#
# This case checks the use of a single relative-path -C option,
# in --append mode.
#
# (Tar 1.26 would remove files in original working directory when called in
# this manner.  [It would follow the -C for archiving the files, but ignore it
# for removing them afterwards.]
