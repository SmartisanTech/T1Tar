# The --exclude-tag options interacted incorrectly with --listed-incremental
# since their very inception.  The testcases exclude08 through exclude16
# verify that --exclude-tag operates consistently whether or not
# --listed-incremental option is given.
#
# This testcase verifies whether the --exclude-tag option alone works
# as expected, i.e. excludes the contents of the directory containing
# the tag, but preserves the directory and the tag itself.
