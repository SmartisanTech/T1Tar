# Description: For some intermediate versions of tar 1.26.90,
# tar would fail to correctly cannonicalize archive member names
# in incremental mode if there was a -C options with an absolute path
# on the command line without any archive members specified within that
# directory. (In that case, the canonical name generated for
# members specified after later -C options wouldn't correctly reflect the
# previous absolute path.)
